# simple-chat-app-socker.io
A chat application using socket.io. Just learning

Using socket.io, I have experimented a simple chat application. This is interesting to develop. A lot more to go !!

Current features:
1. Group chat
2. Notifies when a user joins/leaves.

To be done:
1. Show 'Typing' if a user types.
2. Alignment of my message to right and the rest to left 
3. Last online time to be displayed.
4. Offline message
5. Support user profile pictures.
6. Improve themes
7. Read message and suggest replies (NLP)
8. Make the chat window as a chat popup at side.
