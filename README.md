# simple-chat-app-socker.io
A chat application using socket.io. Just learning

Using socket.io, I have experimented a simple chat application. This is interesting to develop. A lot more to go !!

Current features:
1. Group chat
2. Notifies when a user joins/leaves.
3. Show 'Typing' if a user types.
4. Alignment of my message to right and the rest to left 
5. Pictures upload supported

To be done:
1. Last online time to be displayed.
2. Offline message
3. Support user profile pictures.
4. Improve themes
5. Read message and suggest replies (NLP)
6. Make the chat window as a chat popup at side.
7. Mobile application
